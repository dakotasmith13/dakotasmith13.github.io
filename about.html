                <h2>HOW IT STARTED</h2>
                <p>Hey everyone, my name is Kat, I am a bit of a car enthusiast, and I just bought my first 
                    project car, a 1990 Mazda Miata. I have been interested 
                    in cars from a young age, ever since I would watch my dad wrench on his old cars. 
                    Since then, I have been gradually learning more and more about cars. 
                    For a while, cars weren’t something I was all that interested in, I just had a 
                    decent amount of knowledge about them. However, once I turned 16 and learned to
                    drive, my thoughts shifted. I learned to really enjoy driving, and it allowed 
                    me to have a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that allow cars to drive. 
                    It also allowed me to have more respect for these vehicles and their capabilities. 
                    Shortly after I learned how to drive, my dad bought a Ford Mustang, and once you 
                    drive a car that is that much fun, it’s hard to go back. After that, I bought 
                    my first car, a 2012 Mini Cooper S. Not only did it have a turbo and some slight 
                    modifications, but it also had a 6-speed manual transmission.  Driving a standard 
                    transmission allowed me to feel more connected to the car and made it even more fun 
                    to drive. Eventually, I sold that car, and bought a more reliable and practical car 
                    for being a college student. I also started working in the service department of a 
                    car dealership here in Burlington, where I am continuing to learn more and more about 
                    cars every single day.

                <h2>BUYING THE MIATA</h2>
                <p>A couple weeks ago I finally decided that I was going to buy a project car. 
                    I had the knowledge, resources, and tools to do it, so I did. 
                    After doing a ton of research, I decided that I wanted an NA Miata.
                    Miatas are a perfect project car for several reasons. First of all, 
                    there’s plenty of them. It’s easy enough to find a Miata in decent shape. 
                    Second, they’re fairly cheap. Because there are so many of them and they 
                    are easy to find, they aren’t all that expensive. Third, they are reliable. 
                    The reason that there are so many 30-year-old Miatas around is not 
                    only because so many of them were made, but they are also extremely reliable. 
                    Lastly, Miata parts are extremely easy to source, and there is a ton of 
                    aftermarket support for them, meaning you can do almost anything you want. 
                    Not to mention that the roadster is so extremely fun to drive. 
                    So on 4/24/22 I bought a Miata in Delaware, and a few days later I drove 
                    it all the way up to Vermont.
