                <h2>BUYING THE MIATA</h2>
                <p>A couple weeks ago I finally decided that I was going to buy a project car. 
                    I had the knowledge, resources, and tools to do it, so I did. 
                    After doing a ton of research, I decided that I wanted an NA Miata.
                    Miatas are a perfect project car for several reasons. First of all, 
                    there’s plenty of them. It’s easy enough to find a Miata in decent shape. 
                    Second, they’re fairly cheap. Because there are so many of them and they 
                    are easy to find, they aren’t all that expensive. Third, they are reliable. 
                    The reason that there are so many 30-year-old Miatas around is not 
                    only because so many of them were made, but they are also extremely reliable. 
                    Lastly, Miata parts are extremely easy to source, and there is a ton of 
                    aftermarket support for them, meaning you can do almost anything you want. 
                    Not to mention that the roadster is so extremely fun to drive. 
                    So on 4/24/22 I bought a Miata in Delaware, and a few days later I drove 
                    it all the way up to Vermont.
